# Test Check

*Implement the missing code, denoted by ellipses. You may not modify the pre-existing code.*

Your professor gave the class a bonus task: Write a program that will check the
answers for the latest test. The program will be given a table **answers** with the following columns:

- **id** - the unique ID of the question;
- **correct_answer** - the correct answer to the question, given as a string;
- **given_answer** - the answer given to the question, which can be NULL.

Your task is to return the table with
- column *id*
- column *checks*

where for each **answers** *id* the following string should be returned:

- "no answer" if the *given_answer* is empty;
- "correct" if the *given_answer* is the same as the *correct_answer*;
- "incorrect" if the *given_answer* is not empty and is incorrect.

Order the records in the answer table by *id*.
